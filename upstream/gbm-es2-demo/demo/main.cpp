   * the software-GPU driver's teardown. A native Linux run has a TTY stdin with
   * no pending keypress, so select() blocks and the cube renders continuously.
   * Reproduce that platform behaviour (a POSIX/stdin substitution, not a client
   * change): point fd 0 at the read end of an empty pipe whose write end we keep
   * open, so stdin never signals readable/EOF and the demo runs until the host
   * tears it down — identical observable behaviour to upstream with no input.
   * iOS/macOS already block on stdin, so this is a no-op safety net there. #140 */
